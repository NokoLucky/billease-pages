<h1>Privacy Policy for BillEase</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 2025</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how BillEase collects, stores, and protects your information.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>BillEase uses <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> to create and manage user accounts. When you sign up or log in, Firebase may collect your email address or other login credentials depending on the authentication method you choose.</p>

<p>BillEase stores your bills, due dates, and related data in a secure <strong>Firebase database</strong>. This allows you to access your information across devices and ensures it is backed up safely in the cloud.</p>
